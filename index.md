With datapack export, you can export your song to a datapack. Just copy the generated datapack to your world's "datapacks" folder, and then you: 
* Can **play** your song by running ```/function <datapack_name>:play```
* Can **pause** your song by running```/function <datapack_name>:pause```
* Can **stop** your song by running ```/function <datapack_name>:stop```

Datapack export also has an option to allow nearby players to hear the music too. This way you can be a walking music player!

Also, datapacks support more tempo's than note blocks, so you may just find the perfect tempo when exporting as a datapack.


#### Dark theme:

Well wonder no more! With dark theme you can compose all night long!
